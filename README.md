valvat
===========

[![rubygems](https://badgen.net/rubygems/v/valvat)](https://rubygems.org/gems/valvat) [![Specs](https://github.com/yolk/valvat/workflows/Specs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yolk/valvat/actions?query=workflow%3ASpecs)

Validates european vat numbers. Standalone or as a ActiveModel validator.

## A note on Brexit

Valvat supports validating VAT-IDs from the UK by syntax & checksum for now. Validation against the VIES web service will probably stop working (and return `false`) in 2021.

Northern Ireland received its own VAT number prefix - XI which is supported by VIES web service so any XI-prefixed VAT numbers should be validated as any EU VAT number.

## Features

* Simple syntax verification
* Lookup via the VIES web service
* ActiveModel/Rails integration
* Works standalone without ActiveModel
* I18n locales for language specific error messages in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Czech, Slovakian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Latvian, Catalan, Norwegian, and Finnish.
* *Experimental* checksum verification

valvat is tested and works with ruby MRI 2.6/2.7/3.0/3.1, jruby and ActiveModel 5/6/7. If you need support for ruby down to 1.9.3 and ActiveModel 3 and 4 use [v1.0.1](https://github.com/yolk/valvat/tree/v1.0.1).

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'valvat'
```

To use less memory (~0.5 mb vs. ~3.5 mb) and load only the local verification functionality – and not the remote lookup with VIES – add it like this instead:

```ruby
gem 'valvat', require: 'valvat/local'
```

In any case run:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install valvat

## Validate the syntax of a VAT number

To verify the syntax of a vat number:

```ruby
Valvat.new("DE345789003").valid?
# => true or false
```

It is also possible to bypass initializing a Valvat instance and check the syntax of a vat number string directly with:

```ruby
Valvat::Syntax.validate("DE345789003")
# => true or false
```

## Validate against the VIES web service

To check if the given vat number exists via the VIES web service:

```ruby
Valvat.new("DE345789003").exists?
# => true or false or nil
```

Or to lookup a vat number string directly via VIES web service:

```ruby
Valvat::Lookup.validate("DE345789003")
# => true or false or nil
```

*IMPORTANT* Keep in mind that the VIES web service might be offline at some time for all or some member states. If this happens `exists?` or `Valvat::Lookup.validate` will return `nil`. See *Handling of VIES maintenance errors* for further details.

### Details & request identifier

If you need all details and not only if the VAT is valid, pass {detail: true} as second parameter to the lookup call.

```ruby
Valvat.new("IE6388047V").exists?(detail: true)
=> {
  :country_code=>"IE", :vat_number => "6388047V", :valid => true,
  :request_date => Date.today, :name=>"GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED",
  :address=>"1ST & 2ND FLOOR ,GORDON HOUSE ,BARROW STREET ,DUBLIN 4"
} or false or nil
```

According to EU law, or at least as Austria sees it, it's mandatory to verify the VAT number of every new customer, but also to check the VAT number periodicaly. To prove that you have checked the VAT number, the VIES Web service can return a `request_identifier`.

To receive a `request_identifier` you need to pass your own VAT number in the options hash. In this example, Google (VAT IE6388047V) is checking the validity of eBays VAT number (LU21416127)

```ruby
Valvat.new("LU21416127").exists?(requester: "IE6388047V")
=> {
  :country_code=>"LU", :vat_number => "21416127", :valid => true,
  :request_date => Date.today, :name=>"EBAY EUROPE S.A R.L.",
  :address => "22, BOULEVARD ROYAL\nL-2449  LUXEMBOURG",
  :company_type => nil, :request_identifier => "some_uniq_string"
} or false or nil
```

If the given `requester` is invalid, a `Valvat::InvalidRequester` error is thrown.

### Handling of VIES maintenance errors

From time to time the VIES web service for one or all member states is down for maintenance. To handle this kind of temporary errors, `Valvat::Lookup#validate` returns `nil` by default to indicate that there is no way at the moment to say if the given VAT is valid or not. You should revalidate the VAT later. If you prefer an error, use the `raise_error` option:

```ruby
Valvat.new("IE6388047V").exists?(raise_error: true)
```

This raises `Valvat::ServiceUnavailable` or `Valvat::MemberStateUnavailable` instead of returning `nil`.

Visit [http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/viesspec.do](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/viesspec.do) for more accurate information at what time the service for a specific member state will be down.

### Handling of other VIES errors

All other errors accuring while validating against the VIES web service are raised and must be handled by you. These include:

 * `Valvat::InvalidRequester`
 * `Valvat::BlockedError`
 * `Valvat::RateLimitError`
 * `Valvat::Timeout`
 * all IO errors

If you want to suppress all known error cases. Pass in the `raise_error` option set to `false`:

```ruby
Valvat.new("IE6388047V").exists?(raise_error: false)
```

This will return `nil` instead of raising a known error.

### Set options for the vies client

Use the `:vies` key to set options for the http client. These options are directly passed to `Net::HTTP.start`.

For example to set timeouts:

```ruby
Valvat.new("IE6388047V").exists?(vies: { open_timeout: 10, read_timeout: 10 })
```

### Skip local validation before lookup

To prevent unnecessary requests, valvat performs a local syntax check before making the request to the VIES web service. If you want to skip this step (for any reason), set the `:skip_local_validation` option to `true`.

## Experimental checksum verification

valvat allows to check vat numbers from AT, BE, BG, DE, DK, ES, FR, FI, GR, IE, IT, LU, NL, PL, PT, SE and SI against a checksum calculation. All other member states will fall back to a basic syntax check:

```ruby
Valvat.new("DE345789003").valid_checksum?
# => true or false
```

These results are more valuable than a simple syntax check, but keep in mind: they can not replace a lookup via VIES.

*IMPORTANT* This feature was tested against all vat numbers I could get my hand on, but it is still marked as *experimental* because these calculations are not documented and may return wrong results.

To bypass initializing a Valvat instance:

```ruby
Valvat::Checksum.validate("DE345789003")
# => true or false
```

## Usage with ActiveModel / Rails

### Loading

When the valvat gem is required and ActiveModel is already loaded, everything will work fine out of the box. If your load order differs just add

```ruby
require 'active_model/validations/valvat_validator'
```

after ActiveModel has been loaded.

### Simple syntax validation

To validate the attribute `vat_number` add this to your model:

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :vat_number, valvat: true
end
```

### Additional lookup validation

To additionally perform a lookup via VIES:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { lookup: true }
```

By default this will validate to true if the VIES web service is down. To fail in this case simply add the `:fail_if_down` option:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { lookup: { fail_if_down: true } }
```

You can pass in any options accepted by `Valvat::Lookup#validate`:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { lookup: { raise_error: true, savon: { log: true } } }
```

### Additional (and experimental) checksum validation

To additionally perform a checksum validation:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { checksum: true }
```

### Additional ISO country code validation

If you want the vat number’s (ISO) country to match another country attribute, use the _match_country_ option:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { match_country: :country }
```

where it is supposed that your model has a method named _country_ which returns the country ISO code you want to match.

### Allow blank

By default blank vat numbers validate to false. To change this add the `:allow_blank` option:

```ruby
validates :vat_number, valvat: { allow_blank: true }
```

### Allow vat numbers outside of europe

To allow vat numbers from outside of europe, add something like this to your model (country_code should return a upcase ISO country code):

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :vat_number, valvat: true, if: :eu?

  def eu?
    Valvat::Utils::EU_MEMBER_STATES.include?(country_code)
  end
end
```

## Utilities

To split a vat number into the country code and the remaining chars:

```ruby
Valvat::Utils.split("ATU345789003")
# => ["AT", "U345789003"]
```

or

```ruby
Valvat.new("ATU345789003").to_a
# => ["AT", "U345789003"]
```

Both methods always return an array. If it can not detect the country or the given country is located outside of europe it returns `[nil, nil]`. Please note that this does not strictly return the ISO country code: for greek vat numbers this returns the ISO language code 'EL' instead of the ISO country code 'GR'.

To extract the ISO country code of a given vat number:

```ruby
Valvat.new("EL7345789003").iso_country_code
# => "GR"
```

To extract the vat country code (first two chars in every european vat number):

```ruby
Valvat.new("EL7345789003").vat_country_code
# => "EL"
```

To normalize a vat number:

```ruby
Valvat::Utils.normalize("atu345789003")
# => "ATU345789003"
```

This basically just removes trailing spaces and ensures all chars are uppercase.

## Usage with IPv6

There seems to be a problem when using the VIES service over IPv6. Sadly this is nothing this gem can address. For details and proposed solutions have a look at [this question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15616833/vies-vat-api-soap-error-ipv6). Thanks to George Palmer for bringing up this issue.
